## 📋 Overview

This repository documents my complete AI Engineering preparation, structured as a **7-phase bootcamp** with hands-on projects at each stage. Each phase builds on the previous one, culminating in production-ready skills and a strong project portfolio.

**Timeline:** ~18-20 weeks  
**Daily Commitment:** 2-3 hours  
**Approach:** Learn by building — no passive tutorials
